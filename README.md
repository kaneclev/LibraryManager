# LibraryManager
Pseudo Library Manager 

This library manager keeps track of a catalogue of books that can be modified and searched through using a variety of specifications.
Using a built in command prompt, the program recieves commands through standard input and has a variety of commands that include adding
books, removing books, and even has a function to pre-load a list of books into the library that the user can then work with afterwards.

There is an account system where a user can make an account and then sign these pseudobooks out.

Administrators only have permission to add brand new books to the catalogue or remove books all together. 

This program uses serialization/deserialization to keep track of data after the program stops.
