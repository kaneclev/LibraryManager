Pseudo Library Manager (in progress 1/2/23)

This library manager keeps track of a catalogue of books that can be modified and searched through using a variety of specifications.
Using a built in command prompt, the program recieves commands through standard input and has a variety of commands that include adding
books, removing books, and even has a function to pre-load a list of books into the library that the user can then work with afterwards.

The library supports a log-in system and also allows the user to make a new account.

Features soon to be added:
